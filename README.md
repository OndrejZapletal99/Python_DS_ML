## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to various areas of data science and machine learning. Here you will find code examples, projects, tutorials, and notes covering topics such as data processing, visualization, modeling, machine learning, neural networks, and more. The goal is to provide a practical resource for both learning and quick reference in Python for data science and machine learning.

## Draw Data - Interactive Classification Playground

The `Draw Data` notebook demonstrates how to use the [drawdata](https://github.com/koaning/drawdata) library to interactively create and classify your own 2D datasets. With this tool, you can manually draw data points, assign them to classes, and instantly see how different machine learning classifiers (such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN) separate your data.

**Key features:**
- Interactive widget for drawing and labeling data points.
- Automatic encoding of class labels.
- Visualization of decision boundaries for multiple classifiers.
- Easy comparison of classifier performance on custom datasets.

**How it works:**
1. Use the interactive widget to draw points and assign them to different classes.
2. The notebook encodes your labels and prepares the data for modeling.
3. Several classifiers are trained on your drawn data.
4. For each classifier, the decision boundary is visualized along with your data points, so you can see how well each model separates the classes.

This playground is ideal for learning and teaching the basics of classification, understanding decision boundaries, and experimenting with how different algorithms behave on various data distributions.
